# What are data structures?

- A data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, **and** the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. - Wikipedia
- Primitive data structures are just primitive types: numbers, characters, boolean values, etc.
- Complex data structures house one or more primitive values and their relationships.

# Sets Are For Unique Values

.quote[
The `Set` object lets you store unique values of any type, whether primitive values or object references.

.sig[ MDN Reference ]
]

- Insertion into a `Set` is an O(1) operation, though slower than `.push()`ing to an `Array`.
- Iterating over a `Set` is an O(n) operation, still slower than iterating over an `Array`.
- Removing a specific item from a `Set` is an O(1) operation, _much_ faster than `splice()`ing an item out of an Array.
- `Set`s store _unique_ items, which makes them really handy for de-duplicating items. Important to note, though, that JS considers `Object`s with the same data to still be unique.
- Because of the uniqueness constraint, `Set`s can implement 'set' operations like union, intersection, differentiation, etc. much more efficiently than an `Array`.

???

Maps, WeakMaps, and Objects are similar in that they all store key/value pairs, but each is specialized for its own use case.
  
Review the table...

So, the use cases for Maps and Objects seems pretty straightforward, but what about WeakMaps? In general, these are used to attach additional data to Objects where the Objects themselves may go away and you don't want to hold on to them for the life of the `Map` (your only other option). Not the most common use case, but an important one if you need it.

# Graph Algorithms

- Topological Sort
- Eulerian Circuit
- Kruskal's/Prim's Algorithms (MST)
- Kosaraju's Algorithm (SCC)
]

???

We won't go over all these algorithms, each one could be a talk on its own. Instead, the take-home message here is that by using graph data structures and algorithms, you can solve a variety of problems related to connected systems (like, you know, the internet, a web page, a friend group, etc.). For example, if you wanted to know how many clicks it would take a user to navigate from any arbitrary page on your site to another, that's a graph problem. If you want to check if there
are any pages that _can't_ navigate to a certain page without the user needing to visit the home screen, that's a graph problem too.

---

# Why Types are Cool

.huge[
- Safer code (fewer tests)
- More self-documenting code
- Fewer errors (at run time)
- Faster code (even JavaScript)
- More ergonomic immutability (thus, thread-safety)
]

???

I will not argue that TypeScript is the best language for this. Honestly, if you're looking for a frontend language that really leverages types to the fullest, I'd recommend something like Elm, PureScript, or ReasonML. But, TypeScript looks enough like JavaScript that it made sense to use it as the example language in this talk.

- What if a required field is missing?
- What if the email is malformed?
- What if the DB representation is different?
- _Can we represent impossible states?_

Let's consider some artificial "boundaries" for the code that would interact with this form, which is typically where static typing is the most useful. From the user side, we can think about what happens if one of these "required" fields is left off, or if the email address is nothing like a real email address, or what's going into the text area is SQL injection code, or someone checks multiple of those check boxes, and so on. From the database side, what happens if the DBA decides to
represent empty strings as NULL, or the `firstTime` as a character instead of a proper boolean, or the found indicator as a number instead of the text label? From a more abstract position, without trying to enumerate all the possible pitfalls: is it possible to represent an impossible state using this data model?

You can even have multiple constructors, to produce your desired object type under a variety of circumstances and inputs, but honestly that's a bit more complicated in TypeScript than some other languages. Just know that it's possible.

# Summary

- Carefully considering your data structures will pay off in the short **and** long term.

--

- There are always performance tradeoffs and benefits, being familiar with these will help you choose the right data structure.

--

- Algorithms _depend_ on data structures, not the other way around.

--

- Modeling your data to reflect your mental model of the problem space makes programs easier to reason about and less prone to bugs.

--

- Types are great. (Even if TypeScript is only ok...)
