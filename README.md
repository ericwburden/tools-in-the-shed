# Tools in the Shed

Tired of the same old boring Arrays? Wondering what's so bad about 'unshift'? Come join Code Connector as we discuss how, when, and why to break out some other useful ways to represent data in your programs, including Stacks, Queues, Maps, Graphs, Linked Lists, and more. We'll also touch on Types and why they're so darn handy! This talk will be presented in TypeScript, but the concepts will be (mostly) universal.

This talk was originally delivered at a [CodeConnector](codeconnector.io) meetup on 2022-03-22.
