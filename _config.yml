# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Tired of the same old boring Arrays? Wondering what's so bad about 'unshift'? Come
  join Code Connector as we discuss how, when, and why to break out some other useful
  ways to represent data in your programs, including Stacks, Queues, Maps, Graphs,
  Linked Lists, and more. We'll also touch on Types and why they're so darn handy!
  This talk will be presented in TypeScript, but the concepts will be (mostly)
  universal.
